# SystemC-FMI: Seamless Co-Simulation Between SystemC and FMI

![Dumarey_Polito_logo](images/Dumarey_Polito_logo.jpg)

**SystemC-FMI** is a powerful open-source framework that bridges SystemC and the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI), making it effortless to integrate SystemC-based models with FMI-compliant Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs).

With **SystemC-FMI**, you can easily bring your SystemC simulations into any FMI 3.0–compatible environment, enabling true multi-domain co-simulation and interoperability across tools and platforms.

## ⚡ What SystemC-FMI Offers

* ✅ Wrap SystemC and SystemC-TLM modules as FMUs: automatically convert your SystemC designs into FMI 3.0 Co-Simulation FMUs
* ✅ Automate the entire FMU lifecycle: from generation to compilation to packaging, all streamlined
* ✅ Integrate seamlessly: run co-simulations that combine hardware-accurate models with system-level tools

## 🌍 Why It Matters
By combining SystemC’s precision with FMI’s universality, **SystemC-FMI** enables simulation workflows that were previously complex or fragmented, perfect for cross-domain engineering and digital twin scenarios.

Use it to co-simulate and validate systems such as:

* 🚗 Virtual ECUs and automotive components
* 📶 Mixed-signal or digital-analog environments
* 🧪 Software/hardware-in-the-loop (SIL/HIL) testbenches
